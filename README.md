## 🌐 Overview

This project is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). The goal was to create an app that allows users to view the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size and generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon.

## 🎯 The Challenge

The challenge included the following tasks:

- Designing the app layout to be responsive across different screen sizes.
- Implementing hover states for interactive elements to enhance user feedback.
- Creating functionality to generate a new piece of advice when clicking the dice icon.
